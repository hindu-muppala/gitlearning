# Distributed control system
Git is distributed control system.Means the entire file history is stored in the local system. Means every time we clone
,we are cloning the entire repository history.Git stores the snapshot of files when commited instead of differences.Means if a file has v1
and v2 both are same.Then git refers to v2 by v1 (no new reference is created).And it hashes the snapshot and use SHA hash(hashing occurs 
depends on file directories).
Any change to file has three stages :-
-> Untrack (but git has eye on this)
-> add (tracked -- Snap shots recorded)
-> Commit (Saved--)
# difference between tracked and untracked
touch file1
----now file1 is untracked file ----
git add .
----now file1 is tracked file----
# git monitor the tracked files
